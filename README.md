## Introduction
This is a quick introduction to data science and short example of topic clustering on [National Institute of Standards and Technology](www.nist.gov) newsfeed.

## Getting Started
To follow the example in the workshop, Python 2.7 and pip is required. Here are the steps required for getting started:

0. You can use `sudo easy_install pip` or `brew install python` to install pip.
1. Clone or download a copy of this [repo](https://github.com/StarCYing/open_data_day_dc) to you local machine.
2. Install required packages through pip with this command: `pip install requirements.txt`.
3. Open a local jupyter-notebook instance with this command: `jupyter-notebook <dir_of_cloned_repo>`.
4. A instance of jupyter should have launched on your default browser. Open kMeansClustering.ipynb.
